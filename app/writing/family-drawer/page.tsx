        It feels like whenever the topic of animations (whether that is web or
        otherwise) comes up, the{" "}

      <p className="max-w-2xl mx-auto">
        It represents incredible attention to detail and a deep understanding of
        animation principles. And for this very reason, when I originally
        started learning motion design, I had set aspects of this app as my goal
        to recreate.
      </p>
      <p className="max-w-2xl mx-auto">
        Naturally, the app is filled with lots of great interactions, but here,
        I will focus on just one of them, a wallet options drawer:

      <div className="flex gap-4 my-4 max-w-2xl mx-auto">

        <p className="text-[16px] text-gray-500/60 md:block hidden">
          The drawer itself, straight from the app (2025). Choosing the "Remove
          Wallet" option closes the drawer and opens another confirmation
          dialog, so I did not include that in the video.

        The most important aspect of this whole component is the motion, no

        <span className="code-font">AnimatePresence</span> is crucial here since

        essential for creating smooth height transitions as the drawer content
